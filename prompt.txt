I want to make release.sh

- check if it's ok to release with current repo

- prompt to name of git tag

- make json file for flake.nix
  - version should be refer from git tag, on this time use name got from prompt
  - binary name should refer to projec_name of .goreleaser.yaml
  - if getting value is failed, stop releasing

- git commit the json file, execute `git tag` with name got from prompt and push them
